**I'm Gary GroÃŸgarten**. I'm a Full Stack Software Developer who specializes in building thoroughly designed cross-platform apps. In my free time I do some [open source work](https://github.com/garygrossgarten) and occasionally [write](https://gary.dev) and [tweet](https://twitter.com/garygrossgarten) about it.
